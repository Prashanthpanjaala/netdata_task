# netdata


**Netdata** is a **real-time performance monitoring tool** for systems, applications, containers, and cloud infrastructure. It’s **free**, **open-source**, and super lightweight — designed to provide instant insights into your machine’s health via a web-based dashboard.

---

### 🧠 **What Netdata Does:**

- Monitors **system resources** like:
  - 🧠 CPU, 🧮 RAM
  - 💽 Disk usage and I/O
  - 🌐 Network traffic
  - 🔥 Load averages, swap
- Tracks **application and service metrics** (e.g. MySQL, Nginx, Redis)
- Monitors **Docker containers**, Kubernetes pods, etc.
- Provides **real-time charts** and historical data
- Detects **anomalies and sends alerts**
- Displays all this on a **web dashboard** (auto-refreshing every second)

🐳 What is Docker?
Docker is a containerization platform that lets you package apps and their dependencies into containers — lightweight, standalone units that run consistently across environments.

⚙️ Key Concepts:

Term	What It Means
Image	A blueprint for a container — includes code, dependencies, OS libs
Container	A running instance of an image — isolated, fast, and lightweight
Dockerfile	A script with instructions to build your own Docker image
Docker Hub	A public repository for images (like GitHub but for Docker)


✅ Why Docker is Useful
Portable: Runs the same on dev, staging, prod

Lightweight: Shares the host kernel; faster than VMs

Isolated: Each container runs independently

Fast Deployment: Instant boot-up of pre-built environments

Perfect for Monitoring: You can run tools like Netdata in a container, avoiding manual setup



we should directly copy paste this link in the instance

🔗  wget -O /tmp/netdata-kickstart.sh https://get.netdata.cloud/kickstart.sh && sh /tmp/netdata-kickstart.sh --nightly-channel




we also use tools like prometheus and Grafana
ABOUT PROMETHEUS AND GRAFANA


📡 Prometheus – Monitoring & Metrics Collection
Prometheus is a time-series database and monitoring system developed by SoundCloud. It scrapes metrics from targets (apps, systems, services) at specified intervals and stores them with timestamps.

🔍 What Prometheus Does:
Scrapes metrics from endpoints like /metrics

Stores them efficiently as time-series data

Allows querying with its own language: PromQL

Can trigger alerts via Alertmanager

✅ Typical Targets:
Linux servers

Docker containers

Kubernetes pods

Applications (with exporters)



📊 Grafana – Beautiful Dashboards for Your Metrics
Grafana is a visualization and dashboarding tool that can connect to many data sources, including Prometheus.

🎨 What Grafana Does:
Queries metrics from Prometheus (or others like InfluxDB, Loki)

Displays metrics as interactive graphs, charts, tables

Supports alerts, variables, templating

Offers pre-built dashboards for many services

🔁 Together: Prometheus + Grafana = 👌

Tool	Role
Prometheus	Collects and stores metrics (e.g., CPU, memory, app stats)
Grafana	Visualizes those metrics beautifully with charts and dashboards
